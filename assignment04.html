    <h1>Usability test of Film in Hong Kong</h1>
    <p>After having a basic grasp of the consumer and platform functionality last week, this week I improved the platform functionality by incorporating feedback from my target consumers and redrawing the map of the future journey map and future story map within the site.</p>

      <p>At the same time, I reflected on the business model of the website. I have found that secondary features such as social are not effective in attracting consumers to buy paid memberships; only intuitive price offers can bring attraction. At the same time, most film consumers say they tend to have a long-term, stable buying relationship with the same film store, meaning that initial exposure to the consumer is important. I think this is something that can be used to convince film stores to offer discounted prices for my website in exchange for a more favorable display position.</p>

      <p> Not only that, but I also found that a single monthly membership purchase model was likely to leave the site in the red, as most consumers indicated that they would likely buy enough film in bulk the month they purchased the membership to not have to open it for the next few months. To address this, I decided to offer quarterly/annual memberships at a more favorable price to encourage long-term spending.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to this, I have redesigned the web functionality and created a prototype using Figma for testing. The usability test assisted by 5 volunteers exposed many problems of the website that I haven't realized. And future modification will be made to provide better using experience.</p>
